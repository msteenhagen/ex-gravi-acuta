In recent work on perception philosophers are showing their usual sectarian attitudes. In particular, there's strong disagreement over what can be perceived. In this dispute it has become common to distinguish between _conservatives_ and _liberals_ about perceptual experience. Conservatives hold that the character of perception is exhausted by the representation of so-called low-level properties. Liberals deny the conservative view, and maintain that the character of perception is not exhausted by the representation of low-level properties. The liberal is motivated by a conviction that, at least every now and then, the character of perception is determined by the representation of so-called high-level properties. 

Typical examples of low-level properties include colours, shapes, spatial location, motion, sweetness, pitch, and volume. Typical examples of high-level properties include being a tomato, or more generally the representation of categorial properties. These are examples, and do not yet give us the distinction. Is there even a distinction? To my mind, it is very unclear what authors have in mind when they use the 'low'/'high' labels. Is a content high if it is not low? Is it low if it is not high? Or do 'high' and 'low' both receive independent definition, for example by defining low contents as purely qualitative and high contents as purely sortal?

I fact, it is not uncommon to fudge these questions, and think that we have a clear enough grasp on the distinction to use it in our theorising. Some even think that, in the end, the distinction does not allow for clear definition. As Tim Bayne writes, 

> there is no precise line between low窶人evel and high窶人evel perceptual content. Perception contains multiple levels of content, and it is doubtful whether there is any principled line to be drawn between low窶人evel content on the one hand and high窶人evel content on the other. [@bayne2009aa, p. 388]

If Bayne is right, then the distinction between high and low level contents is much like the distinction between tall and low buildings. In what follows I am interested in two questions. 

1. Does the philosophy of perception need a principled line or a clear definition? 
2. Is there really no way to draw a principled line? 

Bayne and others seem to answer both questions in the negative. I will show that, on both counts, this is wrong. A clear definition is necessary for an adequate understanding of perception, at least with respect to the puzzles that the high/low distinction is commonly to solve. Second, I am confident that the line can be drawn on a principled ground. But, as I will show, that cannot be done _within_ the representationalist framework of perception. If I am right, then the kind of puzzles that have inspired philosophers to wheel in a distinction between high and low level contents of experience cannot be resolved internal to the representationalist framework. I will show that this is methodologically innocent, and that it is possible for the representationalist to draw on other conceptual resources to define the concepts that their theories need.
